# python_for_beginners
I follow along with Beau Barnes and more from FreeCodeCamp to learn Python (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWRfhZUzrAc is the first video in the series).

At the end of this training, I hope to also begin work on these projects (initial list came from this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTJvyKZDFsY) (I will continue to add more so I always have something to work towards):
1. Make My Own git
2. Create an automated to-do list (with reminders!)
3. Basic AI model
4. Finance Tracker (with visualizations)
5. Calculator (for practice)
6. Basic Neural Network
7. Real Time Chat
8. Algorithm Visualizer
9. Chat Bot
10. QR Code Generator
