# python_for_beginners
I follow along with Beau Carnes and more from FreeCodeCamp to learn Python (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWRfhZUzrAc is the first video in the series).

At the end of this training, I hope to also begin work on these projects (initial list came from this resource: https://roadmap.sh/projects?g=python)
1. Task Tracker (CLI)
2. GitHub User Activity (CLI)
3. Expense Tracker (CLI)
4. Number Guessing Game (CLI)
5. Unit Converter (Web App)
6. Personal Blog (Web App)
7. Weather API (API)
8. Blogging Platform API (API)
9. Todo List API (API)
10. Expense Tracker (API)
11. TMDB CLI Tool (CLI)
12. Text-Based, Web-Hosted Game "Barbarian Prince" (Web App) add graphics later somehow? Add function as admin to add game elements instead of having to type hard code everything, too.
13. Caching Proxy (CLI)
14. Markdown Note-taking App (API)
15. URL Shortening Service (API)
16. Broadcast Server (CLI)
17. E-Commerce API (API)
18. Workout Tracker (API)
19. Image Processing Service (API)
20. Movie Reservation System (API)
21. Real-time Leaderboard (API)
22. Database Backup Utility (CLI)
23. Scalable E-Commerce Platform (API)

Day 1 (04.09.25) Log:
I worked through the beginning of the Beau Carnes course and reminded myself of a lot of the Python 3 syntax and completed the Rock Paper Scissors game.

Day 2 (04.10.25) Log:
I watched more of Beau's video, and learned a bit more of some of the nuances of Python 3 syntax.

Day 3 (04.11.25) Log:
I've gotten a little tired of watching videos for so long, so I am revisiting a book that has been on my shelf for a long time -- "Learn Python 3 the Hard Way" by Zed Shaw. It covers so much! I will work through this book instead of watching the umpteenth video... I've tried to learn to code for so long, and have been in the perpetual tutorial hell... If I work through this book, learn just enough to get going, I will then work my way into some projects.
At this point I think I should take a break, I've completed 5/52 exercises for LP3THW.

Day 4 (4.12.25) Log:
I'm cruising through this book while I've got the time to do so on the weekend. It's been very repetitive, but I think that's part of Shaw's process. I'm quickly approaching where I left off when I got the book the first time (exercise 14). I want to commit to completing the book, and actually building projets, not just completing an exercise out of a tutorial.
Time for a break - 16/52 exercises for LP3THW.

Day 5 (4.13.25) Log:
I'm continuing to work through this book, and I'm now farther along than I've ever been. It's cool to see how functional Python can be in so many different ways.

Day 6 (4.14.25) Log:
Exercise 22 is kind of blowing my mind. I understand the programming behind it all, but I don't really get encoding just yet. I'll look for a YouTube video to help explain it.
