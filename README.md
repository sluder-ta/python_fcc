# python_for_beginners
I follow along with Beau Carnes and more from FreeCodeCamp to learn Python (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWRfhZUzrAc is the first video in the series).

At the end of this training, I hope to also begin work on these projects (initial list came from this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTJvyKZDFsY) (I will continue to add more so I always have something to work towards):
1. Make My Own git
2. Create an automated to-do list (with reminders!)
3. Basic AI model
4. Finance Tracker (with visualizations)
5. Calculator (for practice)
6. Basic Neural Network
7. Real Time Chat
8. Algorithm Visualizer
9. Chat Bot
10. QR Code Generator

Day 1 (04.09.25) Log:
I worked through the beginning of the Beau Carnes course and reminded myself of a lot of the Python 3 syntax and completed the Rock Paper Scissors game.

Day 2 (04.10.25) Log:
I watched more of Beau's video, and learned a bit more of some of the nuances of Python 3 syntax.

Day 3 (04.11.25) Log:
I've gotten a little tired of watching videos for so long, so I am revisiting a book that has been on my shelf for a long time -- "Learn Python 3 the Hard Way" by Zed Shaw. It covers so much! I will work through this book instead of watching the umpteenth video... I've tried to learn to code for so long, and have been in the perpetual tutorial hell... If I work through this book, learn just enough to get going, I will then work my way into some projects.
