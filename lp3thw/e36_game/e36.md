# Learn Python3 the Hard Way
## Exercise 36: Design a text-based CLI game.

I want to build out my CLI version of Barbarian Prince! Who needs a roll and write when we can make our own version in the terminal!

A couple of goals:
1. I want to build the game with a couple of modules in mind:
    - I want to have one module that will allow you to follow prompts to create cells for the game.
    - I want to then have the main script pull from the storage for the module above to help with the random generation of the map that you have to persue.

I'm very quickly realizing this is a VERY lofty goal to try and do while I'm still techincally learning Python. This will be a fun little side project as I continue to learn and need a break from the book.
For now, I will just build out a small game inspired by The Legend of Zelda where the goal is to get a treasure from the dungeon and escape before the dungeon consumes you!
